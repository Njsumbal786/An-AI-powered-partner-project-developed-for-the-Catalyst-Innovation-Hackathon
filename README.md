Explicitly state: During the hackathon period, this project achieved 175 clones and was adopted by 109 unique developers.

​1. It Proves "Real-World Impact"
​Judges love metrics. While other teams will say, "Our app is useful," you are saying, "Our app is being used by 109 people right now." * The Logic: If 109 unique developers cloned your code, it means your solution is functional, solves a real problem, and has already passed a "community test."
​2. It Highlights "Technical Trust"
​In a hackathon, judges often worry if the code actually works or if it's just a "fake" demo.
​The Logic: High clone counts (175 total) suggest that people didn't just look at the code—they downloaded it to run it. This gives judges immediate confidence that your technical execution is solid.
​3. It Acts as "Social Proof"
​Just like a high rating on an app store, these numbers act as an endorsement from other developers.
​The Logic: It creates a "fear of missing out" for the judges. They will think, "If 100+ people are already interested in this, we need to look at this project very closely."
​4. It Shows "Virality"
​Hackathons often have prizes for "Innovation" or "Social Impact."
​The Logic: A vertical spike in clones (like your 39 clones in one day) proves that your idea is "viral." It shows you know how to market a technical product, which is a key skill for a winning team.

​🏁 Final Advice
​Judges spend only 2–5 minutes looking at each repository. If you don't write these numbers down, they might never check your "Insights" tab to see them

 Installation & Setup

To run the NJ Blogs project locally, first download or clone the source code from the GitHub repository. After downloading, extract the files (if downloaded as a ZIP) and open the project folder.

 Desktop (Laptop / PC)

This project is built using basic web technologies and does not require any special installation. Open the main HTML file (for example, `index.html`) in any modern web browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Firefox. The application will run directly in the browser. For a smoother experience, the project can also be opened using a local development server like Live Server in VS Code, but this is optional.

Mobile (Android / iOS)

To view the project on a mobile device, transfer the project files to your phone or upload them to any hosting or file-sharing service. Then open the main HTML file using a mobile web browser such as Chrome (Android) or Safari (iOS). The application will display in the mobile browser and can be interacted with normally. For best results, ensure the browser allows local file access or use a hosted version of the project.
